AST technical support had a caller complaining that her mouse was hard to control with the dust cover on. The cover turned out to be the plastic bag the mouse was packaged in.\r\n\r\n    3. Another Compaq technician received a call from a man complaining that the system wouldn't read word processing files from his old diskettes. After trouble-shooting for magnets and heat failed to diagnose the problem, it was found that the customer had labeled the diskettes, then rolled them into the typewriter to type the labels.\r\n\r\n    4. Another AST customer was asked to send a copy of her defective diskettes. A few days later a letter arrived from the customer along with photocopies of the floppies.\r\n\r\n    5. A Dell technician advised his customer to put his troubled floppy back in the drive and close the door.

Yet another Dell customer called to complain that his keyboard no longer worked. He had cleaned it by filling up his tub with soap and water and soaking the keyboard for a day, then removing all the keys and washing them individually.\r\n\r\n    8. A Dell technician received a call from a customer who was enraged because his computer had told him he was \"bad and an invalid\".

An exasperated caller to Dell Computer Tech Support couldn't get her new Dell Computer to turn on. After ensuring the computer was plugged in, the technician asked her what happened when she pushed the power button. Her response, \"I pushed and pushed on this foot pedal and nothing happens.\" The \"foot pedal\" turned out to be the computer's mouse.\r\n\r\n    11. Another customer called Compaq tech support to say her brand-new computer wouldn't  work. She said she unpacked the unit, plugged it in and sat there for 20 minutes waiting for something to happen.

Here is the story: \r\nOn March 23, 1994, the medical examiner viewed the body of Ronald Opus and concluded that he died from a shotgun wound to the head. The decedent had jumped from the top of a ten-story building intending to commit suicide. \r\n\r\nHe left a note to that effect, indicating his despondency. As he fell past the ninth floor, his life was interrupted by a shotgun blast passing through a window, which killed him instantly. Neither the shooter nor the decedent was aware that a safety net had been installed just below at the eighth floor level to protect some building workers and that Ronald Opus would not have been able to complete his suicide the way he had planned. \r\n\r\nOrdinarily, Dr. Mills continued, \"a person who sets out to commit suicide and ultimately succeeds, even though the mechanism might not be what he intended\", is still defined as committing suicide. Mr. Opus was shot on the way to certain death nine stories below at street level, but his suicide attempt probably would not have been successful because of the safety net. This caused the medical examiner to feel that he had a homicide on his hands. \r\n\r\nThe room on the ninth floor from whence the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and his wife. They were arguing vigorously, and he was threatening her with a shotgun. The man was so upset that when he pulled the trigger he completely missed his wife and the pellets went through the window striking Mr. Opus. \r\n\r\nWhen one intends to kill subject A, but kills subject B in the attempt, one is guilty of the murder of subject B. When confronted with the murder charge, the old man and his wife were both adamant. They both said they thought the shotgun was unloaded. The old man said it was his long standing habit to threaten his wife with the unloaded shotgun. He had no intention to murder her, therefore the killing of Mr. Opus appeared to be an accident; that is, the gun had been accidentally loaded. \r\n\r\nThe continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couple's son loading the shotgun about six weeks prior to the fatal accident. It transpired that the old lady had cut off her son's financial support and the son, knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly, loaded the gun with the expectation that his father would shoot his mother. \r\n\r\nThe case now becomes one of murder on the part of the son for the death of Ronald Opus. \r\n\r\nNow comes the exquisite twist; further investigation revealed that the son was in fact Ronald Opus. He had become increasingly despondent over both the loss of his financial support and the failure of his attempt to engineer his mother's murder. This led him to jump off the ten-story building on March 23rd, only to be killed by a shotgun blast passing through the ninth-story window. The son had actually murdered himself, so the medical examiner closed the case as a suicide.","category":"News / Politics","id":"173","title":"Murder?

You are not to read further unless you are sitting down, okay?    \r\n \r\nWell, then, I'm getting along pretty well now.  The skull fracture and the concussion I got when I jumped out of the window of my dormitory when it caught fire shortly after my arrival here is pretty well  healed.  I only spent two weeks in the hospital and now I can see almost normally and only get those sick headaches once a day.    \r\n \r\nFortunately, the fire in the dormitory and my jump was witnessed by an attendant at the gas station near the dorm, and he was the one who called the fire department and the ambulance.  He also visited me in the hospital and since I have nowhere to live because of the burnt-out dormitory, he was kind enough to invite me to share his apartment.    \r\nIt's really a basement room, and it's kind of cute.  \r\n\r\nHe is a very fine boy and we have fallen deeply in love and are planning to get married. We haven't set the exact date yet, but it will be before my pregnancy  begins to show.  I know how much you are looking forward to being   grandparents, and I know you will welcome the baby and give it the  same love and devotion and tender care you gave me when I was a child.    \r\n\r\nThe reason for the delay in our marriage is that my boyfriend has a minor infection that prevents us from passing our premarital blood tests and I carelessly caught it from him.  I have bumps all over my \"down there\" but this will soon clear up with the penicillin injections I am taking daily.  I know that you will welcome him into our family with open arms.  He is kind and although not well educated, he is ambitious.

They'd claim their toaster was compatible with all brands and styles of bread, but when you got it home, you'd discover the Bagel Engine was still in development, the Croissant Extension was three years away, and that, indeed, the whole appliance was just blowing smoke.\r\n \r\nIf Hewlett-Packard made toasters... They would market the Reverse Toaster, which takes in toast and gives you regular bread. \r\n\r\nIf IBM made toasters... They would want one big toaster, where people bring bread to be submitted for overnight toasting. IBM would claim a worldwide market for five, maybe six toasters. \r\n\r\nIf Xerox made toasters... You could toast one-sided or double-sided. Successive slices would get lighter and lighter. The toaster would jam your bread for you. \r\n\r\nIf Radio Shack made toasters... The staff would sell you a toaster, but not know anything about it. Or you could buy all the parts to build your own toaster. \r\n\r\nIf Thinking Machines made toasters... You would be able to toast 64,000 pieces of bread at the same time. \r\n\r\nIf Cray made toasters... They would cost $16 million, but would be faster than any other single-slice toaster in the world. \r\n\r\nIf the Rand Corporation made toasters... It would be a large, perfectly smooth, and seamless black cube. Every morning there would be a piece of toast on top of it. Their service department would have an unlisted phone number, and the blueprints for the box would be highly classified, government documents. The X-Files would have an episode about it. \r\n\r\nIf the NSA made toasters... Your toaster would have a secret trap door that only the NSA could access in case they needed to get at your toast for reasons of national security. \r\n\r\nIf Sony made toasters...

They would be cheap and small quartz-crystal wrist toasters that take a licking and keep on toasting. \r\n\r\nIf Fisher Price made toasters... 'Baby's First Toaster' would have a hand-crank that you turn to toast the bread and then pops it up like a jack-in-the-box. \r\n\r\nIf Microsoft made toasters... Every time you bought a loaf of bread, you would have to buy a toaster. You wouldn't have to take the toaster, but you'd still have to pay for it, anyway. Toaster '02 would weigh 15,000 pounds (requiring a reinforced steel countertop), draw enough electricity to power a small city, take up 95% of the space in your kitchen, would claim to be the first toaster that lets you control how light or dark you want your toast to be, and would secretly interrogate your other appliances to find out who made them.

This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the weakest members. \r\nIn much the same way the human brain can only operate as fast as the slowest brain cells. Excessive intake of alcohol, we all know, kills off brain cells, but naturally it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first. \r\n\r\nIn this way, regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker brain cells, constantly making the brain a faster and more efficient machine.","category":"Bar","id":"7725","title":"Beer"},{"body":"Justification for beer and ice cream! But stay away from the pizza!\r\n\r\nAs we all know, it takes 1 calorie to heat 1 gram of water 1 degree centigrade. Translated into meaningful terms, this means that if you eat a very cold dessert (generally consisting of water in large part), the natural processes which raise the consumed dessert to body temperature during the digestive cycle literally suck the calories out of the only available source, your body fat.\r\n\r\nFor example, a dessert served and eaten at near 0 degrees C (32.2 deg. F) will, in a short time, be raised to the normal body temperature of 37 degrees C (98.6 deg. F).  For each gram of dessert eaten, that process takes approximately 37 calories as stated above.  The average dessert portion is 6 oz, or 168 grams.  Therefore, by operation of thermodynamic law, 6,216 calories (1 cal./gm/deg. x 37 deg. x 168 gms) are extracted from body fat as the dessert's temperature is normalized.\r\n\r\nAllowing for the 1,200 latent calories in the dessert, the net calorie loss is approximately 5,000 calories.\r\n\r\nObviously, the more cold dessert you eat,the better off you are and the faster you will lose weight, if that is your goal.\r\n\r\nThis process works equally well when drinking very cold beer in frosted glasses.  Each ounce of beer contains 16 latent calories, but extracts 1,036 calories (6,216 cal. per 6 oz. portion) in the temperature normalizing process.  Thus the net calorie loss per ounce of beer is 1,020 calories.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to calculate that 12,240 calories (12 oz. x 1,020 cal./oz.) are extracted from the body in the process of drinking a can of beer.\r\n\r\nFrozen desserts, e.g., ice cream, are even more beneficial, since it takes 83 cal./gm to melt them (i.e., raise them to 0 deg. C) and an additional 37 cal./gm to further raise them to body temperature. The results here are really remarkable, and it beats running hands down.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, for those who eat pizza as an excuse to drink beer, pizza (loaded with latent calories and served above body temperature) induces an opposite effect.  But, thankfully, as the astute reader should have already reasoned, the obvious solution is to drink a lot of beer with pizza and follow up immediately with large bowls of ice cream.\r\n\r\nWe could all be thin if we were to adhere religiously to a pizza, beer, and ice cream diet.\r\n\r\nHappy eating!","category":"Bar","id":"7730","title":"The Beer And Ice Cream Diet"},{"body":"I've often wanted to drown my troubles, \r\nbut i can't get my wife to go swimming!","category":"One Liners","id":"7738","title":"Drown You Troubles"},{"body":"Few women admit their age, Few men act theirs.","category":"One Liners","id":"7741","title":"Age"},{"body":"Never test the depth of water with both feet.\r\n\r\nDon't take candy from strangers, unless they offer you a ride.\r\n\r\nI'll start exercising as soon as i get into shape.\r\n\r\nIf you have something to say, raise your hand and put it over your mouth.\r\n\r\nMaybe you should go to e-bay and buy a clue.\r\n\r\nEarth is full. go home.\r\n\r\nGee, I'd like to care, but I wasn't given that gene.\r\n\r\nMirrors don't lie, and lucky for you, they can't laugh either.

Repeating the process several times more that day, he ends up with almost $100 and arrives home that night with several bags of groceries for his family.\r\n\r\nDuring the night he decides to repeat the tomato business the next day. By the end of the week he is getting up early every day and working into the night. He multiplies his profits quickly.    Early in the second week he acquires a cart to transport several boxes of tomatoes at a time, but before a month is up he sells the cart to buy a broken-down pickup truck.    At the end of a year he owns three old trucks. His two sons have left their neighborhood gangs to help him with the tomato business, his wife is purchasing the tomatoes he resells, and his daughter is taking night courses at the community college so she can keep books for him.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the second year he has a dozen very nice used trucks and employs fifteen previously unemployed people, all selling tomatoes. He continues to work hard.  Time passes and at the end of the fifth year he owns a fleet of nice trucks and a warehouse that his wife supervises, plus two tomato farms that the boys manage. The tomato company's payroll has put hundreds of homeless and jobless people to work. His daughter reports that the business grossed over one million dollars.    Planning for the future, he decides to buy some life insurance.\r\n\r\nConsulting with an insurance adviser, he picks an insurance plan to fit his new circumstances. Then the adviser asks him for his e-mail address in order to send the final documents electronically.    When the man replies that he doesn't have time to mess with a computer and has no e-mail address, the insurance man is stunned,    \"What, you don't have e-mail? No computer? No Internet? Just think where you would be today if you'd had all of that five years ago!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" snorts the man. \"If I'd had e-mail and the internet five years ago, I would be sweeping floors at Microsoft and making $5.35 an hour.\"\r\n\r\nWhich brings us to the moral of the story:    Since you got this story by e-mail, you're probably closer to being a janitor than a millionaire.\r\n\r\nSadly, I received it also.","category":"Tech","id":"9005","title":"Email and Internet"},{"body":"How many rich people does it take to screw in a lightbulb?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNone.

Never leave diskettes in the disk drive, as data can leak out of the disk and corrode the inner mechanics of the drive. Diskettes should be rolled up and stored in pencil holders. \r\n\r\n2. Diskettes should be cleaned and waxed once a week. Microscopic metal particles can be removed by waving a powerful magnet over the surface of the disk. Any stubborn metallic shavings can be removed with scouring powder and soap. When waxing the diskettes, make sure the surface is even. This will allow the diskette to spin faster, resulting in better access time. \r\n\r\n3. Do not fold diskettes unless they do not fit into the drive. \"Big\" diskettes may be folded and used in \"little\" disk drives. \r\n\r\n4. Never insert a diskette into the drive upside down. The data can fall off the surface of the disk and jam the intricate mechanics of the drive. \r\n\r\n5. Diskettes cannot be backed up by running them through the xerox machine. If your data is going to need to be backed up, simply insert two diskettes into the drive. Whenever you update a document, the data will be written on both diskettes. \r\n\r\n6. Diskettes should not be inserted or removed from the drive while the red light is flashing. Doing so could result in smeared or possibly unreadable text. Occasionally the red light remains flashing in what is known as a \"hung\" or \"hooked\" state. If your system is \"hooking\" you will probably need to insert a few coins before being allowed access to the slot. \r\n\r\n7. If your diskette is full and you need more storage space, remove the disk from the drive and shake vigorously for 2 minutes. This will pack the data enough (Data Compression) to allow for more storage. Be sure to cover all the openings with scotch tape to prevent loss data. \r\n\r\n8. Access time can be greatly improved by cutting more holes in the diskette jacket. This will provide more simultaneous access points to the disk. \r\n\r\n9. Diskettes may be used as coasters for beverage glasses, provided that they are properly waxed beforehand. Be sure to wipe the diskettes dry before using. (see item 2 above) \r\n\r\n10. Never use scissors and glue to manually edit documents. The data is stored much too small for the naked eye, and you may end up with data from some other document stuck in the middle of your document. Razor blades and scotch tape may be used, however, provided the user is equipped with an electron microscope. \r\n\r\n11.

I've been running the same version of DrinkingBuddies 1.0 forever, as my primary application, and all the GirlFriend releases I've\r\ntried have always conflicted with it.\r\n\r\nI hear that DrinkingBuddies won't crash if GirlFriend is run in background mode and the sound is turned off, but I'm embarrassed to say I can't find the switch to turn the sound off. I just run them separately, and it works\r\nokay. GirlFriend also seems to have a problem co-existing with my Leisure 3.1 and QuietTime programs, often trying to abort them with some sort of timing incompatibility.\r\n\r\nI probably should have stayed with GirlFriend 1.0, but I thought I might see better performance from GirlFriend 2.0. After months of conflicts and other problems, I consulted a friend who has had experience with GirlFriend 2.0. He said I probably didn't have enough cache to run GirlFriend 2.0, and eventually it would require a Token Ring to run properly. He was right - as soon as I purged my cache, it uninstalled itself.\r\n\r\nShortly after that, I installed GirlFriend 3.0 beta. All the bugs were supposed to be gone, but the first time I used it, it gave me a virus anyway. I had to clean out my whole system and shut down for a while to re-check my hardware.\r\n\r\nI very cautiously upgraded to GirlFriend 4.0. This time I used a SCSI probe first and also installed a virus protection program. It worked okay for a while, until I discovered that GirlFriend 1.0 was still in my system. I\r\ntried running GirlFriend 1.0 again with GirlFriend 4.0 still installed, but GirlFriend 4.0 has a \"feature\" I didn't know about that automatically detects the presence of any other version of GirlFriend and communicates with it in the background in some way, which results in the immediate removal of both versions.\r\n\r\nThe version I have now works pretty well, but there are still some problems. Like all versions of GirlFriend, it is written in some obscure language I can't understand, much less reprogram. Frankly I think there is too much attention paid to the look and feel rather than the desired functionality. Also, to get the best connections with your hardware, you usually have to use gold-plated contacts, which is very expensive. And I've never liked how GirlFriend is totally \"object-oriented\", as that interface is sometimes cumbersome and even counter-intuitive.\r\n\r\nA year ago, a friend of mine upgraded his version of GirlFriend to GirlFriendPlus 1.1, which is a Terminate and Stay Resident version of GirlFriend. To his dismay, however, he discovered that GirlFriendPlus 1.1 expires within a year of the upgrade, if you don't upgrade AGAIN to Fiancee 1.0. So he did, but soon after that, he had to upgrade YET AGAIN to Wife 1.0, which he describes as a HUGE resource hog.\r\n\r\nIt has taken up all his space, so he can't load anything else. In fact, it has even automatically deleted several of his other programs to make room for itself, not the least of which was DrinkingBuddies 1.0, which used to be one of his favorite applications, as well. This is particularly disturbing to me, as we used to run DrinkingBuddies 1.0 on a network with several of our mutual friends, and now he can't even connect any more!\r\n\r\nHe told me that one of the primary reasons he decided to go with Wife 1.0 was because it came bundled with FreeSexPlus, which sounded great. Well, it turns out the resource allocation module of Wife 1.0 sometimes inexplicably\r\nprohibits access to FreeSexPlus, particularly when he starts the new Plug-Ins he wanted to try. Also, for no apparent reason, the OralSex 1.0 module that worked fine in his previous versions of GirlFriendPlus and Fiancee, stopped working the instant the upgrade to Wife 1.0 finished\r\ninstalling.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, Wife 1.0 must be running on a well warmed-up system before he can do anything with the FreeSexPlus module. This warming up process requires him to run an antiquated version of ForePlay Beta, which has an\r\nagonizingly slow interface, and which has an unfortunate tendency to crash, requiring a cold reboot to his system. The real insult to injury however, is that even though he did not ask for it, Wife 1.0 came embedded with MotherInLaw 2.0, which has an irritating automatic pop-up feature he can't turn off.\r\n\r\nI told him to try installing Mistress 1.0 (which I had heard works great in such situations), but he said he heard if you try to run it without first uninstalling Wife 1.0, Wife 1.0 will delete all of your MSMoney files before doing an uninstall of itself; then Mistress 1.0 won't install anyway because of insufficient resources.\r\n\r\nPlease help me Bob, I don't know what to do. Since the initial release, I have had nothing but problems.\r\n\r\nI've heard that I would really like the CoolGirlFriend 1.0 Deluxe Upgrade (which is supposed to come bundled with a completely functioning version of FreeSexDeluxe), but that release is no where to be found - not even the Beta version! That release is also supposed to come with its own resource management module seamlessly layered in, so it won't conflict with any of my other programs (barring previous versions of GirlFriend, which I would happily delete!).\r\n\r\nPlease advise.","category":"Tech","id":"9674","title":"Girlfriend 1.0"},{"body":"One day, about a month ago, the president was looking for a call girl.

In early October [2005] a major research institution announced discovery of the heaviest element yet known to science. The new element has been named \"Government.\" \r\n\r\nGovernmentium (Gv) has one neutron, 25 assistant neutrons, 88 deputy neutrons, and 198 assistant deputy neutrons, giving it an atomic mass of 312. \r\n\r\nThese 312 particles are held together by forces called morons, which are surrounded by vast quantities of lepton like particles called peons. Since Gv has no electrons, it is inert. However, it can be detected, because it impedes every reaction with which it comes into contact. A minute amount of Gv causes one reaction to take over four days to complete, when it would normally take less than a second! \r\n\r\nGv has a normal half-life of 4 years; it does not decay, but instead undergoes a reorganization in which a portion of the assistant neutrons and deputy neutrons exchange places. In fact, Governmentium's mass will actually increase over time, since each reorganization will cause more morons to become neutrons, forming isodopes. \r\n\r\nThis characteristic of moron promotion leads some scientists to believe that Gv is formed whenever morons reach a certain quantity in concentration. This hypothetical quantity is referred to as Critical Morass. \r\n\r\nWhen catalyzed with money, Gv becomes Administratium (Am) - an element which radiates just as much energy as Gv since it has half as many peons but twice as many morons.","category":"News / Politics","id":"11554","title":"Governmentium"},{"body":"Jt/xmktp?akhjgp/uqpuRujgrt/pvP/tq/tkHqtjhqtjb!)<(]{,twmjtwmjtwmkadnjgptkgptjafmjipV9mkBRiECl88888888888888888888888888888888888888887777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777777I won at the slots! modge???? i m ?!?! bubbye *cheffy!=","category":"Knock-Knock","id":"11557","title":"Money, Money, Money!"},{"body":"Money can't buy everything... but then again, neither can no money.","category":"One Liners","id":"11563","title":"Money"},{"body":"Legs is the word - spread the word.","category":"One Liners","id":"11572","title":"Legs"},{"body":"'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the Net,\r\nThere were hackers a surfing.

If the Spanish could gain the Netherlands they would have a stronghold throughout northern Europe which would include their posetions in Italy, Burgundy, central Europe and India thus serrounding France. The German Emperor's lower passage was blocked by the French for years and years.\r\n\r\nLouise XIV became King of the Sun. He gave the people food and artillery. If he didn't like someone, he sent them to the gallows to row for the rest of their lives. Vauban was the royal minister of flirtation. In Russia the 17th century was known as the time of the bounding of the serfs. Russian nobles wore clothes only to humour Peter the Great. Peter filled his goverment with accidental people and built a new capital near the European boarder. Orthodox priests became government antennae.\r\n\r\nThe enlightenment was a reasonable time. Voltare wrote a book called Candy that got him into trouble with Frederick the Great. Philosophers were unknown as yet, and the fundamental stake was one of religious toleration slightly confused with defeatism. France was in a serious state. Taxation was a great drain on the state budget. The French revolution was accomplished before it happened. The revolution evolved through republican and tolarian phases until it catapulted into Napolean. Napoleon was ill with bladder problems and was very tense and unrestrained.\r\n\r\nHistory, a record of things left behind by past generations, started in 1815. Throughout the comparatively radical years 1815-1870 the western European continent was undergoing a Rampant period of economic modification. Industrialisation was precipitating in England.\r\n\r\nProblems were so complexicated that in Paris, out of a city population of 1 million people, 2 million able bodies were on the loose.\r\n\r\nGreat Brittian, the USA and other European countries had demicratic leanings. The middle class was tired and needed a rest. The old order could see the lid holding down new ideas beginning to shake. Among the goals of the chartists were universal suferage and anal parliment. Voting was to be done by ballad.","category":"College","id":"12589","title":"Student Errors (Sic) II"},{"body":"Here is a collection of freshman history bloopers collected by a Canadian history professor (Anders Henrickson) over the years.\r\n\r\nDuring the Middle Ages, everybody was middle aged. Church and state were cooperatic. Middle Evil society was made up of monks, lords and surfs. It is unfortunate that we do not have a medivel European laid out on a table before us, ready for dissection.\r\n\r\nAfter a revival of infantile commerce slowly creeoed into Europe, merchants appeared. Some were sitters and some were drifters. They roamed from town to town exposing themselves and organized big fairies in the countryside.\r\n\r\nMideval people were violent. Murder during this Period was nothing. Everybody killed someone. England fought numerously for land in France and ended up wining and losing. The Crusades were a series of military expaditions made by Christians seeking to free the holy land (the \"Home Town\" of Christ) from the Islams.\r\n\r\nIn the 1400 hundreds most Englishmen were perpendicular. A class of yeowls arose. Finally Europe caught the Black Death. The bubonic plague is a social disease in the sense that it can be transmitted by intercourse and other etceteras. It was spread from port to port by infected rats. Victims of the Black Death grew boobs on their necks. The plague also helped the emergance of the English language as the national language of England, France and Italy.\r\n\r\nThe Middle Ages slimpared to a halt. The renasence bolted in from the blue. Life reeked with joy. Italy became robust, and more individuals felt the value of their human being. Italy, of course, was much closer to the rest of the world thanks to Northern Europe. Man was determined to civilise himself and his brothers, even if heads had to roll! It became sheik to be educated. Art was on a more associated level. Europe was full of incredable churches with great art bulging out of their doors. Renaissance merchants were beautiful and almost lifelike.\r\n\r\nThe Reformnation happened when German nobles resented the idea that tithes were going to Papal France or the Pope, thus enriching Catholic coiffures. Traditions had become oppressive so they too were crushed in the wake of man's quest for ressurection above the not-just-social beast he had become. An angry Martin Luther nailed 95 theocrats to a church door. Theologically, Luthar was into reorientation mutation. Calvinism was the most convenient religion since the days of the ancients. Anabaptist services tended to be migratory. The Popes, of course, were usually Catholic. Monks went right on seeing themselves as worms. The last Jesuit priest died in the 19th century.","category":"College","id":"12590","title":"Student Errers (Sic) III"},{"body":"Knock-Knock! \r\n\r\nWho's there?\r\n\r\nMaida. \r\n\r\nMaida who? \r\n\r\nMaida force be with you!","category":"Knock-Knock","id":"12593","title":"Maida"},{"body":"The theory of evolution was greatly objected to because it made man think.\r\n\r\nThree kinds of blood vessels are arteries, vanes and caterpillers.\r\n\r\nThe dodo is a bird that is almost decent by now.\r\n\r\nTo remove air from a flask, fill it with water, tip the water out, and put the cork in quick before the air can get back in.\r\n\r\nThe process of turning steam back into water again is called conversation.\r\n\r\nA magnet is something you find crawling all over a dead cat.\r\n\r\nThe Earth makes one resolution every 24 hours.\r\n\r\nThe cuckoo bird does not lay his own eggs.\r\n\r\nTo collect fumes of sulfur, hold a deacon over a flame in a test tube.\r\n\r\nParallel lines never meet, unless you bend one or both of them.\r\n\r\nAlgebraical symbols are used when you do not know what you are talking about.\r\n\r\nGeometry teaches us to bisex angles.\r\n\r\nA circle is a line which meets its other end without ending.\r\n\r\nThe pistol of a flower is its only protection against insects.","category":"College","id":"12596","title":"Student Errors (Sic) IV"},{"body":"The moon is a planet just like the Earth, only it is even deader.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the reptiles came from the amphibians by spontaneous generation and study of rocks.\r\n\r\nEnglish sparrows and starlings eat the farmers grain and soil his corpse.\r\n\r\nBy self-pollination, the farmer may get a flock of long-haired sheep.\r\n\r\nIf conditions are not favorable, bacteria go into a period of adolescence.\r\n\r\nVegetative propagation is the process by which one individual manufactures another individual by accident.\r\n\r\nA super-saturated solution is one that holds more than it can hold.\r\n\r\nA triangle which has an angle of 135 degrees is called an obscene triangle.\r\n\r\nBlood flows down one leg and up the other.\r\n\r\nA person should take a bath once in the summer, and not quite so often in the winter.\r\n\r\nThe hookworm larvae enters the human body through the soul.\r\n\r\nWhen you haven't got enough iodine in your blood you get a glacier.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that a deceased body harms the mind.\r\n\r\nHumans are more intelligent than beasts because the human branes have more convulsions.","category":"College","id":"12597","title":"Student Errers (Sic) V"},{"body":"For fainting: rub the person's chest, or if a lady, rub her arm above the hand instead.\r\n\r\nFor fractures: to see if the limb is broken, wiggle it gently back and forth.\r\n\r\nFor dog bite: put the dog away for several days.

In her statement she described how she came up to the intersection leading into her downtown condo, and rear ended the driver in front of her due to his 'complete and full stop'. She continues to say that of the almost 2 years of living in that particular condominium complex, she had not once been behind someone who had made a full stop at the stop sign, and that his inability to be 'consistent with typical driving patterns' caused the accident. As a result, she is convinced that Mr. Thompson is directly responsible for the accident and should be held accountable for all incurred costs of repair to both vehicles. When reminded that it is the law to make a complete stop at a stop sign, her abrupt response was \"I am quite capable of deciding when it is a good or bad time to stop my vehicle.\"\r\n\r\nOwner of Perfect House Lives in Car\r\nSeptember 18, 2002 - Baltimore, USA\r\n\r\nIn fear of possibly disturbing the perfection that is his house, Donald Manison has been forced to live in his 1998 Dodge Caravan. \"I became obsessive, everything in the house was so photo-perfect that I was eventually scared of walking on the carpet in fear that I might disturb the direction of the carpet threads.\" Magazines wanting a glimpse and photos of the perfect house were limited to viewing through opened ground floor windows.

Campaign producer Ted Zielchman commented, \"All of the actors we were getting from the talent agencies were too intelligent, and these are people who are usually rejected based on lack of intelligence, so we are faced with a unique problem. I believe though, based on the applicants for the contest so far, we have some likely candidates. Some were unable to even spell their name and had that 'not so bright look on their face' - consistent with the first batch of actors we used.

It is easy to make and you don't need milk or a stove. And student said microwaves were forbidden by the RA. And God said to him, you shall hide the microwave under your bed with a towel on top. And Student asked, what if it is discovered. And God told him to stop being such a pussy, and it was good. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVII- Thou Shalt Hook Up \r\n\r\nStudent then asked of sex. And God said, Student, you shall hook up and be happy. You shall go home with random people every weekend and forget about them the next day. You shall see them at class and be awkward amongst their company. You shall exchange saliva at bars and parties and it will be good. And Student became gleeful and God told Student to wrap it up because He knows where she has been, but Student does not. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nVIII- Thou Shalt Join a Club and Never Go to Meetings \r\n\r\nStudent inquired of his spare time and God reminded him that he should be napping. But Student said he wanted to do other things. So God said unto him, you shall join a club at the beginning of the semester, but then never go to meetings. And Student asked why he should not go to meetings, and God told him, because the glee club is gay. And Student understood His wisdom. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIX- Thou Shalt Wake Up Confused \r\n\r\nGod said to Student, there will come many a day when you shall wake up in the bed of another and not know where you are. You will not remember what you did last night and you shall be confused. You will see that you have nipple rings and a tattoo now and are covered in Sharpie. And Student was disturbed by this, but God said, you shall tell great stories about it to your friends someday. And Student understood and God took a sip of a beer. \r\n\r\nAnd God gave Student the final Commandment \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nX- Thou Shalt Gain Weight \r\n\r\nAnd Student wished to hear the final commandment and God said he would not like it. But Student insisted, so God said unto him, you shall gain weight. However, God said, you will not buy new clothes, so you will wear sweat pants a lot. God said, Student, you will watch a lot of TV and become fat to which Student wept profusely. But God comforted Student saying, you will still get ass even if you cannot tie your shoes anymore. Student felt better and God pointed to Student's chest saying, those will soon be bitch tits.

That's an exceedingly odd number. Why was that gauge used? \r\nBecause that's the way they built them in England, and the US railroads were built by English expatriates. Why did the English people build them like that? Because the first rail lines were built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's the gauge they used. Why did \"they\" use that gauge then? Because the people who built the tramways used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used that wheel spacing. Why did the wagons use that odd wheel spacing? Well, if they tried to use any other spacing the wagons would break on the old long distance roads, because that's the spacing of the old wheel ruts. So who built these old rutted roads? The first long distance roads in Europe were built by \r\nImperial Rome for the benefit of their Legions. The roads have been used ever since. And the ruts? The initial ruts, which everyone else had to match for fear of destroying their wagons, were first made by Roman war chariots. \r\nSince the chariots were made for or by Imperial Rome they were all alike in the matter of wheel spacing. Thus, we have the answer to the original questions. The United States standard railroad gauge of 4 feet, 8.5 inches \r\nderives from the original specification for an Imperial Roman army war chariot. Specs and Bureaucracies live forever. So, the next time you are handed a specification and wonder what horse's behind came up with it, you \r\nmay be exactly right.

Your neighbors pick someone to tell you who gets the milk.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN DEMOCRACY\r\nThe government promises to give you two cows if you vote for it. After the election, the president is impeached for speculating in cow futures. The press dubs the affair \"Cowgate\".\r\n\r\nBRITISH DEMOCRACY\r\nYou have two cows. You feed them sheep's brains and they go mad. The government doesn't do anything.\r\n\r\nBUREAUCRACY\r\nYou have two cows. At first the government regulates what you can feed them and when you can milk them. Then it pays you not to milk them. After that it takes both, shoots one, milks the other and pours the milk down the drain. Then it requires you to fill out forms accounting for the missing cows.\r\n\r\nANARCHY\r\nYou have two cows. Either you sell the milk at a fair price or your neighbors kill you and take the cows.\r\n\r\nCAPITALISM \r\nYou have two cows. You sell one and buy a bull.\r\n\r\nHONG KONG CAPITALISM \r\nYou have two cows. You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap with associated general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax deduction for keeping five cows. The milk rights of six cows are transferred via a Panamanian intermediary to a Cayman Islands company secretly owned by the majority shareholder, who sells the rights to all seven cows' milk back to the listed company. The annual report says that the company owns eight cows, with an option on one more. Meanwhile, you kill the two cows because the Feng Shui is bad.\r\n\r\nENVIRONMENTALISM \r\nYou have two cows. The government bans you from milking or killing them.\r\n\r\nFEMINISM \t\r\nYou have two cows. They get married and adopt a veal calf.\r\n\r\nTOTALITARIANISM \t\r\nYou have two cows. The government takes them and denies they ever existed. Milk is banned.\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL CORRECTNESS \t\r\nYou are associated with (the concept of \"ownership\"is a symbol of the phallo-centric, war-mongering, intolerant past) two differently-aged (but no less valuable to society) bovines of non-specified gender.\r\n\r\nCOUNTER CULTURE \t\r\nWow, dude, there's like... these two cows, man. You got to have some of this milk. Far out! Awesome!\r\n\r\nSURREALISM \t\r\nYou have two giraffes. The government requires you to take harmonica lessons.\r\n\r\nJAPANESE DEMOCRACY \t\r\nYou have two cows. You give the milk to gangsters so they don't ask any awkward questions about who you're giving the milk to.\r\n\r\nEUROPEAN FEDERALISM\r\nYou have two cows which cost too much money to care for because everybody is buying milk imported from some cheap east-European country and would never pay the fortune you'd have to ask for your cows' milk. So you apply for financial aid from the European Union to subsidise your cows and are granted enough subsidies. You then sell your milk at the former elevated price to some government-owned distributor which then dumps your milk onto the market at east-European prices to make Europe competitive. You spend the money you got as a subsidy on two new cows and then go on a demonstration to Brussels complaining that the European farm-policy is going drive you out of your job.\r\n\r\nEASTERN EUROPEAN DEMOCRACY\r\nYou have two cows. You sell the milk (diluted with some water) at a high price to the neighbors or to anyone at the open-air market. If somebody asks for receipt, you charge for a two times higher price, so nobody will request an invoice. For concerned families with small babies you claim that the milk is \"bio\", though you collect the grass for feeding at the side of the highway and you keep the milk in plastic barrels used previously as containers of dangerous chemicals. Later, your neighbor or anybody from town will steal the cows and will buy their meat for a high price, and if you ask for a receipt, you will be charged for a two times higher price.\r\n\r\nFINNISH SOCIALISM\r\nYou have two cows. Soon you have to kill one of them because in the Netherlands there is an overproduction of milk and the European Union rules say so. When you do so, you realize that it was not necessary, only the system was too slow in getting you the up-to-date news. From the stress, you get an ulcer in your stomach so you go to a doctor. The doctor realizes that this ulcer is a serious one, so you need an urgent treatment. Therefore, you soon get a call to the local hospital. The call's date is for 3 months later, because there is a queue with more urgent cases. Then your ulcer becomes even more serious because you remember that 40 percent of your income is taken for social tax.","category":"News / Politics","id":"15153","title":"On Cows and Government"},{"body":"The Blonde walked into a bar.

They agreed that it was.\r\n\r\nSo, he picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand filled up everything else. He again asked the students if the jar was full. They responded with a unanimous \"yes\".\r\n\r\nThe professor then produced two cans of beer from under the table and proceeded to pour their entire contents into the jar - effectively filling the empty space between the sand. The students laughed.\r\n\r\nAs the laughter subsided, the professor said, \"Now, I want you to recognize that this jar represents your life. The rocks are the important things - your family, your partner, your health, your children - things that if everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full. The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your house, your car. The sand is everything else - the small stuff.\r\n\r\n\"If you put the sand into the jar first,\" he continued, \"there is no room for the pebbles or the rocks. The same goes for your life. If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to you. Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness. Play with your children. Take time to get medical checkups. Take your partner out dancing. There will always be time to go to work, clean the house, give a dinner party and fix the faucet. Take care of the rocks first, the things that really matter. Set your priorities. The rest is just sand.\"\r\n\r\nAt that point, one of the students raised her hand and asked what the beer represented.\r\n\r\nSmiling, the professor replied, \"I'm glad you asked. It just goes to show you that no matter how full your life may seem, there's always room for a couple of beers.\"","category":"College","id":"15193","title":"Priorities of Life"},{"body":"We regret to inform you, but by opening this email, you have just received the 'Idiot Computer Virus'.\r\n\r\nSince our staff does not have any programming experience, this virus works on the honor system.\r\n\r\nPlease delete all files from your hard drive immediately, then manually forward this virus to everyone on your mailing list.\r\n\r\nThank You","category":"Tech","id":"15207","title":"Idiot Computer Virus"},{"body":"What's the hardest thing about rollerblading?\r\n\r\nTelling your parents that you are gay.","category":"One Liners","id":"15208","title":"Rollerblading"},{"body":"The Ultimate Computer stood at the end of the Ultimate Computer Company's production line.\r\n\r\nWhen the guided tour arrived, a salesman stepped forward to give his prepared demo. \"This baby here,\" he said, \"is the Ultimate Computer.

The length of the string plus the length of the barometer will equal the height of the building.\"\r\n\r\nThis highly original answer so incensed the examiner that the student was failed. The student appealed on the grounds that his answer was indisputably correct, and the university appointed an independent arbiter to decide the case.\r\n\r\nThe arbiter judged that the answer was indeed correct, but did the problem it was decided to call the student in and allow him six minutes in which to provide a verbal answer which showed at least a minimal familiarity with the basic principles of physics.\r\n\r\nFor five minutes the student sat in silence, forehead creased in thought. The arbiter reminded him that time was running out, to which the student replied that he had several extremely relevant answers, but couldn't make up his mind which to use.\r\n\r\nOn being advised to hurry up the student replied as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Firstly, you could take the barometer up to the roof of the skyscraper, drop it over the edge, and measure the time it takes to reach the ground. The height of the building can then be worked out from the formula H = 0.5g x t squared. But bad luck on the barometer.\r\n\r\n\"Or if the sun is shining you could measure the height of the barometer, then set it on end and measure the length of its shadow. Then you measure the length of the skyscraper's shadow, and thereafter it is a simple matter of proportional arithmetic to work out the height of the skyscraper.\r\n\r\n\"But if you wanted to be highly scientific about it, you could tie a short piece of string to the barometer and swing it like a pendulum, first at ground level and then on the roof of the skyscraper. The height is worked out by the difference in the gravitational restoring force T = 2 pi sqroot (l / g).\r\n\r\n\"Or if the skyscraper has an outside emergency staircase, it would be easier to walk up it and mark off the height of the skyscraper in barometer lengths, then add them up.\r\n\r\n\"If you merely wanted to be boring and orthodox about it, of course, you could use the barometer to measure the air pressure on the roof of the skyscraper and on the ground, and convert the difference in millibars into feet to give the height of the building.\r\n\r\n\"But since we are constantly being exhorted to exercise independence of mind and apply scientific methods, undoubtedly the best way would be to knock on the janitor's door and say to him 'If you would like a nice new barometer, I will give you this one if you tell me the height of this skyscraper.'\"\r\n\r\nThe student was Niels Bohr, the only person from Denmark to win the Nobel prize for Physics.","category":"College","id":"15215","title":"The Skyscraper and the Barometer."},{"body":"I inherited a painting and a violin which turned out to be a Rembrandt and a Stradivarius.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Rembrandt made lousy violins and Stradivarius was a terrible painter. - Tommy Cooper","category":"One Liners","id":"15230","title":"A Painting and a Violin"},{"body":"It takes fewer muscles to smile than to frown - and fewer still to ignore someone completely.","category":"One Liners","id":"15233","title":"Grim Ace"},{"body":"I believe no problem is so large or so difficult that it can't be blamed on someone else.","category":"One Liners","id":"15234","title":"What's YOUR Problem?"},{"body":"How can you be sad when you are at the Sunshine Happiness Parade of Friendly Friends?","category":"One Liners","id":"15251","title":"Sunshine Friendship"},{"body":"People always say that hard work never killed anybody.

Zeno argued that motion is an illusion. Now, by motion he meant movement, and not the rude kind that involves bowels but the Newtonian kind. He did this by the Achilles (A) and the Tortoise (T) parable. For argument's sake, say A runs 10 times faster than T can crawl. Then let T be placed 10 meters ahead of A at the start of a race. When A has moved 10 meters, T has moved 1 meter, so T is now still 1 meter ahead of A. Then when A has covered that 1 meter, T has gone 1/10 meter ahead. Etc. So, A will never ever pass T. Poor Zeno, it was reported that he found this logic so persuasive that he did not bother to move again, a kind of ontological constipation perhaps?\r\n\r\nBut the naughty version of it is a bit sexist (feminists, please reverse male and female roles in this story!). It goes like this. A psychologist wanted to test the difference in logical thinking between engineering and mathematics majors, and for this purpose he set up an experiment in which the subjects were respectively a male Mathematics and a randy male Engineering undergraduate. He showed them into the lab. At the far end of the long, narrow room was a luscious semi-clad bimbo. His instructions were like so: \"Fellas, I have in my hands a buzzer that I will sound every minute. Every time I do that, you can walk half the distance that remains between yourself and the lady. Should you ever reach her, you will find her most accommodating. Do you wish to participate in the experimemt?\"\r\n\r\nMath major: \"You don't fool me.

If the deal goes through, it will be the first time a computer software company has acquired a major world religion. With the acquisition, Pope John Paul II will become the senior vice-president of the combined company's new Religious Software Division, while MICROSOFT senior vice-presidents Michael Maples and Steven Ballmer will be invested in the College of Cardinals, said MICROSOFT Chairman Bill Gates.\r\n\r\n\"We expect a lot of growth in the religious market in the next five to ten years,\" said Gates. \"The combined resources of MICROSOFT and the Catholic Church will allow us to make religion easier and more fun for a broader range of people.\"\r\n\r\nThrough the MICROSOFT Network, the company's new on-line service, \"we will make the sacraments available on-line for the first time\" and revive the popular pre-Counter-Reformation practice of selling indulgences, said Gates. \"You can get Communion, confess your sins, receive absolution - even reduce your time in Purgatory - all without leaving your home.\"\r\n\r\nA new software application, MICROSOFT Church, will include a macro language which you can program to download heavenly graces automatically while you are away from your computer.\r\n\r\nAn estimated 17,000 people attended the announcement in St Peter's Square, watching on a 60-foot screen as comedian Don Novello - in character as Father Guido Sarducci - hosted the event, which was broadcast by satellite to 700 sites worldwide.\r\n\r\nPope John Paul II said little during the announcement. When Novello chided Gates, \"Now I guess you get to wear one of these pointy hats,\" the crowd roared, but the pontiff's smile seemed strained.\r\n\r\nThe deal grants MICROSOFT exclusive electronic rights to the Bible and the Vatican's prized art collection, which includes works by such masters as Michelangelo and Da Vinci, but critics say MICROSOFT will face stiff challenges if it attempts to limit competitors' access to these key intellectual properties.\r\n\r\n\"The Jewish people invented the look and feel of the holy scriptures,\" said Rabbi David Gottschalk of Philadelphia. \"You take the parting of the Red Sea - we had that thousands of years before the Catholics came on the scene.\"\r\n\r\nBut others argue that the Catholic and Jewish faiths both draw on a common Abrahamic heritage. \"The Catholic Church has just been more successful in marketing it to a larger market. Over the last 2,000 years, the Catholic Church's market share has increased dramatically, while Judaism, which was the first to offer many of the concepts now touted by Christianity, lags behind.\r\n\r\nHistorically, the Church has a reputation as an aggressive competitor, leading crusades to pressure people to upgrade to Catholicism, and entering into exclusive licensing arrangements in various kingdoms whereby all subjects were installed with Catholicism, whether or not they planned to use it. Today Christianity is available from several denominations, but the Catholic version is still the most widely used. The Church's mission is to reach \"the four corners of the earth,\" echoing MICROSOFT's vision of \"a computer on every desktop and in every home\".\r\n\r\nGates described MICROSOFT's long-term strategy to develop a scalable religious architecture that will support all religions through emulation. A single core religion will be offered with a choice of interfaces according to the religion desired - \"One religion, a couple of different implementations,\" said Gates.\r\n\r\nThe MICROSOFT move could spark a wave of mergers and acquisitions, according to Herb Peters, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern Baptist Conference, as other churches scramble to strengthen their position in the increasingly competitive religious market.","category":"Tech","id":"16116","title":"VATICAN CITY (AP)"},{"body":"There was a knock on the door. It was the man from Microsoft.\r\n\r\n\"Not you again,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry,\" he said, a little sheepishly. \"I guess you know why I'm here.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed I did. Microsoft's $300 million campaign to promote the Windows 95 operating system was meant to be universally effective, to convince every human being on the planet that Windows 95 was an essential, some would say integral, part of living. Problem was, not everyone had bought it. Specifically, I hadn't bought it. I was the Last Human Being Without Windows 95. And now this little man from Microsoft was at my door, and he wouldn't take no for an answer.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"You know I can't take that,\" he said, pulling out a copy of Windows 95 from a briefcase. \"Come on. Just one copy. That's all we ask.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not interested.\" I said. \"Look, isn't there someone else you can go bother for a while? There's got to be someone else on the planet who doesn't have a copy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, no,\" The Microsoft man said. \"You're the only one.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't be serious. Not everyone on the planet has a computer,\" I said. \"Hell, not everyone on the planet has a PC! Some people own Macintoshes, which run their own operating system. And some people who have PCs run OS/2, though I hear that's just a rumor. In short, there are some people who just have no use for Windows 95.\"\r\n\r\nThe Microsoft man look perplexed. \"I'm missing your point,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Use!\" I screamed. \"Use! Use! Use! Why buy it, if you can't useit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't know anything about this 'use' thing you're going on about,\" the Microsoft man said. \"All I know is that according to our records, everyone else on the planet has a copy.\"\r\n\r\n\"People without computers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Got 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amazonian Indians?\"\r\n\r\n\"We had to get some malaria shots to go in, but yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Amish?\"\r\n\r\n\"Check.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come on,\" I said. \"They don't even wear buttons. How did you get them to buy a computer operating system?\"\r\n\r\n\"We told them there were actually 95 very small windows in the box,\" the Microsoft man admitted. \"We sort of lied. Which means we are all going to Hell, every single employee of Microsoft.\" He was somber for a minute, but then perked right up. \"But that's not the point!\" he said. \"The point is, everyone has a copy. Except you.\"\r\n\r\n\"So what?\" I said. \"If everyone else jumped off a cliff, would you expect me to do it, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"If we spent $300 million advertising it? Absolutely.\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jeez, back to that again,\" the Microsoft man said. \"Hey. I'll tell you what. I'll give you a copy. For free. Just take it and install it on your computer.\" He waved the box in front of me.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said again. \"No offense, pal. But I don't need it. And frankly, your whole advertising blitz has sort of offended me. I mean, it's a computer operating system! Great. Fine. Swell. Whatever. But you guys are advertising it like it creates world peace or something.\"\r\n\r\n\"It did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon?\"\r\n\r\n\"World peace. It was part of the original design. Really. One button access. Click on it, bang, end to strife and hunger. Simple.\"\r\n\r\n\"So what happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you know,\" he said defensively, \"it took up a lot of space on the hard drive. We had to decide between it or the Microsoft Network. Anyway, we couldn't figure out how to make a profit off of world peace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go away,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"I can't,\" he said. \"I'll be killed if I fail.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have got to be kidding,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" the Microsoft man said. \"We sold this to the Amish. The Amish! Right now, they're opening the boxes and figuring out they've been had. We'll be pitchforked if we ever step into Western Pennsyvania again. But we did it. So to have you holding out, well, it's embarassing. It's embarassing to the company. It's embarassing to the product. It's embarassing to Bill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bill Gates does not care about me,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"He's watching right now,\" the Microsoft man said. \"Borrowed one of those military spy satellites just for the purpose. It's also got one of those high-powered lasers. You close that door on me, zap, I'm a pile of grey ash.\"\r\n\r\n\"He wouldn't do that,\" I said, \"He might hit that copy of Windows 95 by accident.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Bill's gotten pretty good with that laser,\" the Microsoft man said, nervously.\r\n\"Okay. I wasn't supposed to do this, but you leave me no choice. If you take this copy of Windows 95, we will reward you handsomely. In fact, we'll give you your own Caribbean island! How does Montserrat sound?\"\r\n\r\n\"Terrible. There's an active volcano there.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's only a small one,\" the Microsoft man said.\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" I said, \"even if you did convince me to take that copy of Windows 95, what would you do then? You'd have totally saturated the market. That would be it. No new worlds to conquer. What would you do then?\"\r\n\r\nThe Microsoft man held up another box and gave it to me.\r\n\r\n\"'Windows 95....For Pets'?!?!?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's a lot of domestic animals out there,\" he said.\r\n\r\nI shut the door quickly.

And came the minions of the Justice Department, bent upon proving Bill monopolous, yet before his wrath did they quail, and proclaim him innocent, mostly.\r\n\r\nAnd that which was once called Chicago became known as Windows 95, and the suspense built throughout the land, and Bill, remembering what had gone before, set about building a great Hype.\r\n\r\nInto his Hype he put the greatest mouths of the land, and scattered the fruits of his profits so heavily that he bought hosts of angels to sing, and Rolling Stones songs, and trumpets and horns and drums without number.

Here was a chance to make a profit without any initial monetary investment. Naturally, this man then became my competition, so I had my limo driver run over him several times.\"\r\n\r\nMicrosoft engineers have been working around the clock to complete Gates' vision of panhandling for the 21st century. \"We feel that our program designers really understand how the poor and needy situation works,\" says Microsoft Homeless product leader Bernard Liu. \"Except for the fact that they're stinking rich.\"\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Panhandler will be automatically installed with Windows 95. At random intervals, a dialog box pops up, asking the user if they could spare any change so that Microsoft has enough money to get a hot meal. (\"This is a little lie,\" admits software engineer Adam Miller, \"since our diet consists of Coke and Twinkies, but what panhandler doesn't embellish a little?\") The user can click Yes, in which case a random amount of change between $.05 and $142.50 is transferred from the user's bank account to Microsoft's. The user can also respond No, in which case the program politely tells the user to have a nice day. The \"No\" button has not yet been implemented.\r\n\r\n\"We're experiencing a little trouble programming the No button,\" Bernard Liu says, \"but we should definitely have it up and running within the next couple of years. Or at least by the time Windows 2014 comes out.

But he needed a creature who could sail the waters, and would need for support but few rams.\r\n\r\nSo the Gateskeeper, who was said to be both micro and soft, caused to be fashioned a Dosfish, who was small and spry, and could swim the narrow sixteen-bit channel. But the Dosfish was not bright, and could be taught but few tricks. His alphabet had no A's, B's, or Q's, but a mere 640 K's, and the size of his file cabinet was limited by his own fat.\r\n\r\nAt first the people loved the Dosfish, for he was the only one who could swim the Pea Sea. But the people soon grew tired of commanding his line, and complained that he could neither be dragged or dropped. \"Forsooth,\" they cried, \"the Dosfish can do only one job at a time, and of names he knows only eight and three.\" And many of them left the Pea Sea for good, and went off in search of the Magic Apple.\r\n\r\nAlthough many went, far more stayed, because admittance to the Pea Sea was cheap. So the Gateskeeper studied the Magic Apple, and rested awile in the Parc of the Xer Ox. And he made a Window that could ride on the Dosfish, and do its thinking for it. But the Window was slow, and it would break when the Dosfish got confused. So most people contented themselves with the Dosfish.\r\n\r\nNow it came to pass that the Blue Giant came upon the Gateskeeper, and spoke thus: \"Come, let us make of ourselves something greater than the Dosfish.\" The Blue Giant seemed like a humbug, so they called the new creature Oz II.\r\n\r\nNow Oz II was smarter than the Dosfish, as most things are. It could drag and drop, and could keep files without becoming fat. But the people cared for it not. So the Blue Giant and the Gateskeeper promised another Oz II, to be called Oz II Too, that could swim fast in the new, 32-bit wide Pea Sea.\r\n\r\nThen lo, a strange miracle occurred. Although the Window that rode on the Dosfish was slow, it was pretty, and the third window was the prettiest of all. And the people began to like the third window, and to use it. So the Gateskeeper turned to the Blue Giant and said \"Fie on thee, for I need thee not. Keep thy Oz II Too, and I shall make of my Window an Entity that will not need the Dosfish, and will swim in the 32-bit Pea Sea.\"\r\n\r\nYears passed, and the workshops of the Gateskeeper and the Blue Giant were many times overrun by insects. And the people went on using their Dosfish with a Window; even though the Dosfish would from time to time become confused and die, it could always be revived with three fingers. Then there came a day when the Blue Giant let forth his Oz II Too onto the world. The Oz II Too was indeed mighty, and awesome, and required a great ram, and the world was changed not a whit. For the people said \"It is indeed great, but we see little application for it.\" And they were doubtful, because the Blue Giant had met with the Magic Apple, and together they were fashioning a Taligent, and the Taligent was made of objects, and was most pink.\r\n\r\nNow the Gateskeeper had grown ambitious, and as he had been ambitious before he grew, he was now more ambitious still. So he protected his Window Entity with great security, and made its net work both in serving and with peers. And the Entity would swim, not in the Pea Sea, but also in the Oceans of Great Risk. \"Yea,\" the Gateskeeper declared, \"though my Entity will require a greater ram than Oz II Too, it will be more powerful than a world of Eunuchs.\r\n\r\nAnd so the gateskeeper prepared to unleash his Entity to the world, in all but two cities. For he promised that a greater Window, a greater Entity, and even a greater Dosfish would appear one day in Chicago and Cairo, and it too would be built of objects.\r\n\r\nNow the Eunuchs who lived in the Oceans of Great Risk, and who scorned the Pea Sea, began to look upon their world with fear. For the Pea Sea had grown and great ships were sailing in it, the Entity was about to invade their Ocenas, and it was rumored that files would be named in letters greater than eight. And the Eunuchs looked upon the Pea Sea, and many of them thought to immigrate.\r\n\r\nWithin the Oceans of Great Risk were many Sun Worshippers, and they had wanted to excel, and make their words perfect, and do their jobs as easy as one-two-three. And what's more, many of them no longer wanted to pay for the Risk. So the Sun Lord went to the Pea Sea, and got himself eighty-sixed.\r\n\r\nAnd taking the next step was he of the NextStep, who had given up building his boxes of black. And he proclaimed loudly that he could help anyone make wondrous soft wares, then admitted meekly that only those who know him could use those wares, and he was made of objects, and required the biggest ram of all.\r\n\r\nAnd the people looked out upon the Pea Sea, and they were sore amazed. And sore confused. And sore sore. And that is why, to this day, Ozes, Entities, and Eunuchs battle on the shores of the Pea Sea, but the people still travel on the simple Dosfish.","category":"Tech","id":"16124","title":"The History of Operating Systems"},{"body":"What does the \"95\" in Windows95 mean anyway?\r\n\r\n10.

After lengthy inquiries about how PCs should and could be used (including some angry comments on some questions which Mr. Gates evidently did not like), the interviewer comes to storage requirements of MS products; it ends with the following dispute:\r\n\r\n          ---------------------------------------------------------\r\n  FOCUS: Every new release of a software which has less bugs than the older one is also more complex and has more features...\r\n\r\nGates: No, only if that is what'll sell!\r\n\r\nFOCUS: But...\r\n\r\nGates: Only if that is what'll sell! We've never done a piece of software unless we thought it would sell. That's why everything we do in software ...it's really amazing: We do it because we think that's what customers want. That's why we do what we do.\r\n\r\nFOCUS: But on the other hand, you would say: Okay, folks, if you don't like these new features, stay with the old version, and keep the bugs?\r\n\r\nGates: No! We have lots and lots of competitors. The new version, it's not there to fix bugs. That's not the reason we come up with a new version.\r\n\r\nFOCUS: But there are bugs an any version which people would really like to have fixed.\r\n\r\nGates: No! There are no significant bugs in our released software that any significant number of users want fixed.\r\n\r\nFOCUS: Oh, my God. I always get mad at my computer if MS Word swallows the page numbers of a document which I printed a couple of times with page numbers. If I complain to anybody they say \"Well, upgrade from version 5.11 to 6.0\".\r\n\r\nGates: No! If you really think there's a bug you should report a bug. Maybe you're not using it properly. Have you ever considered that?\r\n\r\nFOCUS: Yeah, I did...\r\n\r\nGates: It turns out Luddites don't know how to use software properly, so you should look into that. The reason we come up with new versions is not to fix bugs. It's absolutely not. It's the stupidest reason to buy a new version I ever heard. When we do a new version we put in lots of new things that people are asking for, and so, in no sense, is stability a reason to move to a new version. It's never a reason.\r\n\r\nFOCUS: How come I keep being told by computer vendors, \"Well, we know about this bug, wait till the next version is there, it'll be fixed\"? I hear this all the time. How come? If you're telling me there are no significant bugs in software and there is no reason to do a new version?\r\n\r\nGates: No. I'm saying: We don't do a new version to fix bugs. We don't. Not enough people would buy it. You can take a hundred people using Microsoft Word. Call them up and say, \"Would you buy a new version because of bugs?\"\r\n\r\nYou won't get a single person to say they'd buy a new version because of bugs. We'd never be able to sell a release on that basis.\r\n\r\nFOCUS: Probably you have other contacts to your software developers. But if Mister Anybody, like me, calls up a store or a support line and says, \"Hey listen, there's a bug\" ... 90 percent of the time I get the answer \"Oh, well, yeah, that's not too bad, wait to the next version and it'll be fixed\". That's how the system works.\r\n\r\nGates: Guess how much we spend on phone calls every year.\r\n\r\nFOCUS: Hm, a couple of million dollars?\r\n\r\nGates: 500 million dollars a year. We take every one of these phone calls and classify them. That's the input we use to do the next version. So it's like the worlds biggest feedback loop. People call in, we decide what to do on it. Do you want to know what percentage of those phonecalls relates to bugs in the software? Less than one percent.\r\n\r\nFOCUS: So people call in to say \"Hey listen, I would love to have this and that feature\"?\r\n\r\nGates: Actually, that's about five percent. Most of them call to get advice on how to do a certain thing with the software. That's the primary thing. We could have you sit and listen to these phone calls. There are millions and millions of them. It really isn't statistically significant. Sit in and listen to Win 95 calls, sit in and listen to Word calls, and wait, just wait for weeks and weeks for someone to call in and say \"Oh, I found a bug in  this thing\"....\r\n\r\nFOCUS: So where does this common feeling of frustration come from that unites all the PC users? Everybody experiences it every day that these things simply don't work like they should.\r\n\r\nGates: Because it's cool. It's like, \"Yeah, been there done that. Oh, yeah, I know that bug.\" I can understand that phenomenon sociologically, not technically.\r\n\r\n          ---------------------------------------------------------\r\nSo:\r\n\r\n      * Bug reports are statistically, therefore actually, unimportant;\r\n      * If you want a bug fixed, you are (by definition) in the minority;\r\n      * Microsoft doesn't fix bugs because bug fixes are not a significant source of revenue;\r\n      * If you think you found a bug, you are wrong, because really it only means you're incompetent; and\r\n      * People only complain about bugs to show how cool they are, not because bugs cause any real problems.","category":"Tech","id":"16129","title":"A Serious Interview With Your Favourite Geek"},{"body":"Beyond the Hype (Guardian, August 25, 1995)\r\n\r\nDouglas Adams, author of the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, argues Windows 95 does not cross any frontiers.\r\n\r\nWhat on Earth is going on? Have we found intelligent life on other planets? Abolished war and famine? Found Elvis? Have we even devised a new and better way of using computers? No. All that's happened is that Microsoft has remodelled its operating system so that it's now more like the Macintosh.\r\n\r\nThis may well be a cause for rejoicing among Windows users but it's hardly a giant leap for mankind and doesn't warrant this sense that we're all supposed to celebrate early and avoid the millennium rush.\r\n\r\nAs part of this billion-dollar festival of smoke and mirrors, Bill Gates has apparently paid the Rolling Stones 8 million pounds for the right to use Start Me Up, the song which is better known for its catchy refrain \"You make a grown man cry\".\r\n\r\nThis is a phrase you may hear a lot of over the next few days as millions of people start trying to install Windows 95. Even the best designed systems can be a nightmare to upgrade, but whatever things Microsoft may be famous for - the wealth of its founder, the icy grip he exerts on what is arguably the most important industry on this planet - good systems design is not, as it happens, one of them.\r\n\r\nLet's dispel a few myths. There's one which says that the original PC operating system was a brilliant feat of programming by boy genius Bill Gates. It wasn't brilliant and Gates didn't write it. He acquired it, \"shrewdly\", from the Seattle Computer Company and then immediately licensed it on to another, larger, outfit called IBM. When the IBM PC was launched into a market which had hitherto been serviced by garage companies named after bits of fruit, it carried the impimatur of a world-renowned name and sold a zillion, making Gates' operating system a world standard. IBM had failed to realise that any fool could make the boxes, but the hand that owned the software ruled the world. Big Blue had given the kid Gates a free ride into the stratosphere and then, astoundingly, found itself starting to fall away like a discarded booster rocket.\r\n\r\nSadly this new world software standard was actually a piece of crap.\r\n\r\nMS-DOS, as Gates called it, had started life as QDOS-86 or the Quick & Dirty Operating System, which told you all you needed to know about it. A whole generation of people doggedly learned to run their businesses on a system that was written as a quick lash-up for hobbyists and hackers. Was there anything better around? Of course.\r\n\r\nIn the 1970's, Xerox had funded a team of the world's top computer scientists to research the man/machine interface. They devised a graphical system, using windows, icons and mice. Their key insight was that a lot of needless complications could be cut short by harnessing people's intuitive and gestural skills. Oddly, Xerox failed to follow this up, and the research was taken up and brought to the market by Apple Computer as the Macintosh. After a shaky, underpowered start, this machine matured into a well-integrated system which was not only very powerful, but a real pleasure to use. Mac users tend to have an almost fanatical devotion to their machines.\r\n\r\nThe Microsoft line on all this was that Windows was for wimps. The truth was that plain old MS-DOS couldn't actually do them. Graphics, mice, networking, and a whole lot else, had to be added to the basic core of QDOS as one afterthought after another, which is why Wintel computers are so fiendishly complicated to set up and maintain.\r\n\r\nGates, however, had always known which way the future lay, and for years Microsoft managed the awkward juggling act of rubbishing Apple's user interface while simultaneously trying to devise something like it that would fit on top of the bloated clutter that MS-DOS had become.\r\n\r\nBYTE magazine said recently: \"It would not be an exaggeration to describe the history of the computer in the past decade as a massive effort to keep up with Apple.\" However, the Macintosh is not the last word on interface design, and if Microsoft had been the innovative company that it calls itself, it would have taken the opportunity to take a radical leap beyond the Mac, instead of producing a feeble, me-too, implementation.\r\n\r\nAn awful lot of people who try to install Windows 95 will end up having to spend so much money buying extra RAM and upgrading their peripherals to get features that Mac users have enjoyed for years, that they might as well give up and buy the real thing.\r\n\r\nThe idea that Bill Gates has appeared like a knight in shining armour to lead all customers out of a mire of technological chaos neatly ignores the fact that it was he who, by peddling second-rate technology, led them into it in the first place.","category":"Tech","id":"16131","title":"Douglas Adams on Windows95"},{"body":"If you have half a brain, you can't help but notice the throng of publications, analysts and net users declaring Windows95 the Saviour of the Computer Industry.

He saw an Xbox and he knew he got enough money for it, so he said he wanted an Xbox and the cashier said: \"Your Xbox will be delivered in 2 or 3 days.\" In 2 days, the doorbell rang. He knew it is the Xbox he ordered. Outside was a man with glasses, holding a box where Ronald thought inside was an Xbox, but when he opened it, he was shocked.\r\n\r\nIt was a box marked with an X on the cover and inside was a game for Xbox only.

Tomorrow, I will don the the uniform of the academic and re-enter society, NOT as I once was, a worker and pawn of the educated classes, but as a peer of those very people. Tomorrow, I shall become an academic!\r\n\r\nJan 4th, 1995\r\nDressed in a pair of green slacks with shortened legs, red cardigan and egg-yolk-stained tee-shirt; sporting a scraggly beard and armed only with a pipe, I stepped onto the university campus. Immediately upon mumbling some incomprehensible gibberish, I was greeted on with respect and awe by my fellow academia. Applying for tenure was simple. The questions were very direct:\r\n\r\nThey: Do you know what you're doing?\r\nMe: This is Belgium, right?\r\nThey: You have a masters in English?\r\nMe: I have a Red Volvo!\r\nThey: And you're applying for a position in the department of Physics?\r\nMe: I think sometimes, therefore I am illogical!\r\n\r\nI was appointed immediately and released to an unsuspecting student population.\r\n\r\nJan 5th, 1995\r\nToday was my first as a lecturer. I prepared concientiously by drinking heavily, watching lots of television and going to bed very late the preceding night turning up at my lecture the prescribed 1 minute late, I spoke of Yeats and the passion of his poetry. The first year Physics students were left speechless.\r\n\r\nJan 6th, 1995\r\nI did not go to work today, due to my thinking it was Saturday.\r\n\r\nJan 7th, 1995\r\nI did not go to work today, due to my thinking it was a Wednesday.\r\n\r\nJan 8th, 1995\r\nI went to work today and was distressed at the lack of attendance.\r\n\r\nJan 9th, 1995\r\nBeing conscientious in the maintenance of my diary, I take a well deserved holiday knowing that in three more days I will be eligible for a six month sabattical.\r\n\r\nJan 12th, 1995\r\nMy lecture this morning was a landmark effort. I launched into the explanation of the right-hand-rule, then, remembering that I was an academic, subverted myself into discussing of the right-hand-rule of hitch-hiking, the dangers of hitchhiking, the dangers of hitching in South America, my holiday in South America, the woman I met in South America, the place she worked at, their physics department, then to finish off, what their physics department said about the right-hand-rule. I think I was well received.\r\n\r\nJan 13th, 1995\r\nA minor peice of confusion here in that I brought my telephone book instead of my lecture notes. I improvised the basic electrical safety section of the course with the aid of two paper clips, a student and a handy power point. I feel sure the class now appreciates the dangers of electricity. Attendance dropped by one.\r\n\r\nJan 14th, 1995\r\nBeing a Friday, I decide to excite my first year pupils with an experiment in wave theory. I walked into the lab, waved, and left. I'm sure my students appreciated the humourous content.\r\n\r\nJan 16th, 1995\r\nHaving now mastered when weekends occur, I turned up to receive confirmation of my sabattical, taking it, on full pay, immediately.\r\n\r\nJul 17th, 1995\r\nBack from sabattical I realise that I did not make arrangements for a stand-in lecturer. In an attempt to catch up for the lost time, I set the students some homework, pages 1-375, read and do all exercises.\r\n\r\nJul 18th, 1995\r\nAttendance was exceptionally low today with only one student in class. When I asked him how his homework was going as his entire coursework depended on it. He screamed and left. I marked him absent and informed the grants department that no-one was attending my courses.\r\n\r\nJul 21st, 1995\r\nMy students are all back having received the letter informing them that grants are only paid to attending students. Scholarship students, with a far harsher attendance policy, are openly weeping.\r\n\r\nJul 24th, 1995\r\nI am now eligible for three months extra-curricular sabattical, which I decide to take immediately, warning my students that the exam will be held the day I return, covering all aspects of the course, including the last minute addition of the Encyclopedia Brittanica to the Book List. I expect all students to have a copy.\r\n\r\nOct 24th, 1995\r\nExam day.\r\nHaving no preparation time, I use last years exam and substitute different values for the equation. I randomly appoint a student from another class to work out the answers and mark the exams.\r\n\r\nOct 27th, 1995\r\nI receive the results of the exam which indicate that 89% of the class passed the exam. Lauded as an academic genius, I am awarded 6 months further paid sabbatical to study the effects of alcohol on the mind. Starting the third day of term next year. I think I'm on a winner here.","category":"College","id":"17439","title":"Professor's Diary"},{"body":"Instructions: Read each question carefully. Answer all questions.\r\nTime limit: 2 hours.

He was, at this point, saying that he wanted to spend about $500 and that everything had to be from the same manufacturer. This was when the 550 P3 had just come out, so prices were still higher than $500 for any system you could go buy in a Circuit City, which he said he HAD to do.)\r\n\r\n    * Him: \"Well, you know, I just want the basic stuff, a monitor, and a printer and a scanner, and maybe a camera, plus the stuff to make cards and print photos and all that, and the stuff to take care of paying my bills, and online.\"\r\n    * Me: \"Ok, well, you need to get a system first, then think about the extras.
